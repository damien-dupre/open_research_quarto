## Abstract 

My presentation will focus on **how Quarto facilitates transparent workflows and shareable outputs**. The key impact highlighted will be enhanced research *reproducibility*, broader *dissemination*, and increased *verifiability*, thereby expanding the reach and trustworthiness of scholarly work [@dupre2025open].

## Research Overview

This communication **will showcase how open research practices are embedded in my work**, which spans psychology, focusing on AI-driven emotion recognition from physiological and facial cues, and data science support for Business School projects in Economics, Accounting, and Public Policy.
